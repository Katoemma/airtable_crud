# Fixing the GitHub Secrets Detection Issue

## üö® The Problem

GitHub detected API keys in your git history and blocked the push:

```
remote: - Push cannot contain secrets
remote: - Airtable Personal Access Token
```

Even though we removed the API keys from the files, they're still in the **git commit history**.

---

## ‚úÖ Solution: Rewrite Git History

You have two options:

### Option 1: Interactive Rebase (Recommended - Simpler)

This works if the API keys are in recent commits (which they are in your case).

```bash
# 1. Find the commit BEFORE the one with API keys
git log --oneline -10
# Look for the commit before "Release v1.3.0"

# 2. Start interactive rebase
git rebase -i 838ae71^  # Use the hash from your git log

# 3. In the editor that opens, you'll see:
#    pick b810c30 Release v1.3.0: Introduced modern API design...
#    pick e181da8 Enhance Airtable CRUD example...
#    pick adb92df Remove outdated documentation files...
#    pick 4e8ed91 Update test file with placeholder values...
#
#    Change 'pick' to 'edit' for commits that added API keys:
#    edit b810c30 Release v1.3.0: Introduced modern API design...
#    pick e181da8 Enhance Airtable CRUD example...
#    pick adb92df Remove outdated documentation files...
#    edit 4e8ed91 Update test file with placeholder values...
#
#    Save and close the editor

# 4. Git will pause at each 'edit' commit
#    Make sure API keys are removed from files:
git show HEAD  # Check if this commit has API keys

# If it does, the files are already clean (we fixed them earlier)
# So just amend without changes:
git commit --amend --no-edit

# Continue to next commit:
git rebase --continue

# 5. Repeat step 4 for each 'edit' commit

# 6. After rebase completes, force push
git push origin v1.3.0 --force
```

### Option 2: Reset and Recommit (Nuclear Option - Easiest)

If Option 1 is confusing, you can simply squash everything:

```bash
# 1. Soft reset to the commit before v1.3.0 work
git reset --soft 838ae71  # The commit before all v1.3.0 changes

# 2. All your changes are now staged
git status  # You'll see all files staged

# 3. Create ONE new clean commit
git commit -m "Release v1.3.0: Modern API design with enhanced features

- Unified fetchRecords() method
- Enhanced error handling with specific exception types
- Immutable record updates with copyWith()
- New bulk operations (update, delete)
- Advanced configuration with AirtableConfig
- Comprehensive documentation and migration guide
- GitHub Actions workflow for automated publishing
- All API keys replaced with placeholders"

# 4. Force push the branch
git push origin v1.3.0 --force
```

## üîç Verify Before Pushing

Before pushing, make sure there are NO API keys:

```bash
# Search for API key patterns
git log -p | grep -E "pat[A-Za-z0-9]{30,}"

# If this returns anything, API keys are still in history!
```

---

## üìù After Fixing

Once you've successfully pushed:

1. **Verify on GitHub**: Check that https://github.com/Katoemma/airtable_crud shows your branch
2. **Create PR or Merge**: Merge v1.3.0 into main
3. **Tag for Release**: Create the `v1.3.0` tag to trigger publishing

```bash
# After merging to main:
git checkout main
git pull
git tag v1.3.0
git push origin v1.3.0
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Revoke Compromised API Keys

Since your API keys were committed to git (even briefly), you should:

1. Go to https://airtable.com/create/tokens
2. Find the compromised tokens
3. **Delete/Revoke them**
4. Create new tokens for future testing

The old keys in git history are visible to anyone who has access to your repository.

---

## üö´ Preventing Future Issues

1. **Use .gitignore** for test files with secrets
   ```
   # Add to .gitignore
   test/local_*.dart
   test/**/*_local.dart
   ```

2. **Use environment variables** in tests
   ```dart
   const apiKey = String.fromEnvironment('AIRTABLE_API_KEY', 
       defaultValue: 'YOUR_API_KEY');
   ```

3. **Always check before committing**
   ```bash
   git diff --cached | grep -E "pat[A-Za-z0-9]{30,}"
   ```

4. **Use pre-commit hooks** (optional)
   ```bash
   # .git/hooks/pre-commit
   #!/bin/bash
   if git diff --cached | grep -qE "pat[A-Za-z0-9]{30,}"; then
       echo "ERROR: Airtable API key detected!"
       exit 1
   fi
   ```

## Need Help?

If you're stuck:

1. Make a backup: `git branch backup-v1.3.0`
2. Try Option 2 (Reset and Recommit) - it's simpler
3. Check GitHub's docs: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository

You can always restore from backup if something goes wrong!
